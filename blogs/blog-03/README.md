## Summary: Fjord, Accenture Interactive, on What AI Success Will Look Like

In this episode, the host spoke with Connor Upton from Fjord, the design and innovation consultancy for Accenture Interactive. Conner talked about how trends in tech are always changing. First, we designed software as a product for people to enjoy and use. Then we shifted to designing software as a service to help people complete jobs. Now we have started writing software as a system to allow groups of people to complete goals. With each of these changes, there was a shift in how we thought about designing software and how the end users would actually interact with it.

The trends in AI are changing as well. Where we originally aimed at automating and cutting costs wherever possible, companies are now finding that there are limits. “AI automates tasks not jobs”, says Conner, and it lacks the “human glue” that completes the full package to handle a job. This is the reason AI design is changing from aiming to automate tasks, to aiming to enhance the human ability/experience with jobs. Fjord's process for implementing AI has changed to reflect this, with a large portion of the time now focused on who the AI will interact with and how that interaction can be made smooth.

## Why I chose The Tech Blog Writer Podcast:

I chose to listen to The Tech Blog Writer podcast because I love hearing about new technologies and changing trends. These types of stories really help to get my brain going and help me to be more innovative in my own projects.

## Benefits of Episode:

This episode seemed cool to me as I am really interested in AI development and think I might one day work in the field. I think it was beneficial for me to listen to it because the trends of today are what decides where the industry (and the jobs) will go from here. I like to keep tabs on as many different areas of Computer Science as I can because it helps to expand what I think is possible which ultimately makes me a better developer.

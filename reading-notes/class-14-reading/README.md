## Class 14 Reading: Access Control (ACL)

#### Why is access control important? Describe an application that would need access control.

Access control is important because it allows you to control who can access what
inside of an application. For instance with WordPress(a popular blogging CMS),
there are several different user roles to control what features a user has access
like reading posts as a subscriber to updating settings as an admin.

#### What is a role used for?

Roles are used to give predefined sets of privilages to a "type" of user. This allows
for an easier way of checking if you have the permissions needed.

#### Why is role based access control more scalable than discretionary or mandatory access control?

Role based access control is more scalable than discretionary or mandatory access
control because it removes the need for the user to give permissions like with
discretionary access, and it is a simple check to check permissions than mandatory
access.

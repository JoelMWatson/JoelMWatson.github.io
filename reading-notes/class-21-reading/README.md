able to reuse a lot of those small components on other pages.

you can create entire web pages without actually writing any HTML at all.

#### What can cause a render (or re-render) of a component?

#### When a render happens, how is the DOM affected

#### What is one thing a framework does that a library doesnâ€™t do?

Both a framework and a library offer you a set of tools to complete tasks. The
difference is that with a framework, there are rigid rules that decided where your
code goes and when it will be called. With a library on the other hand the tool set
is much more flexible and you can use it wherever you like in your applicaiton.

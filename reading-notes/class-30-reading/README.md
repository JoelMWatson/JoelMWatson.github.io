## Class 30 Reading: Graphs Vocabulary

#### Vocab list for Graph Data Structure

- Vertex/Node: The elements stored in the graph.
- Edge: A connection from one vertex to another.
- Neighbors: All the vertices connected to a vertex are considered neighbors of that vertex.
- Degree: The number of neighbors a vertex has.
- Weight: The "priority level" of an edge.
- Undirected Graph: A graph whose edges are all bidirectional.
- Directed Graph: A graph whose edges can be single or bidirectional
- Completed Graph: A graph in which all vertices connect to all other vertices.
- Connected Graph: A graph in which all vertices have at least one edge.
- Disconnected Graph: A graph in which one or more vertices has zero edges.
- Cyclic Graph: A graph that contains an endless loop or cycle
- Acyclic Graph: A graph that contains no endless loops or cycles
- Adjacency Matrix: A N x N matrix of boolean values showing which vertices connect to which.
- Adjacency List: A list that shows all the connected vertices in a list.

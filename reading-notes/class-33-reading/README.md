## Class 33 Reading: Redux - Additional Topics

#### Redux Tool Kit

While redux simplifies the masive task of state management in react, there are several
areas where you have to create a lot of boiler plate code just to get redux working.
To help solve this problem they have come out with tools like ReduxToolKit that greatly
reduce the amount of boiler plate code by giving developers a single file to manage
slice of your state and its reducers, actions instead of breaking it accross three
files. In the background, redux tool kit is building out your reducers and actions
for you from the data entered into and maintained in a single file which drastically
reducers the mental strain of trying to keep track of all of the data when updating
slices of your state.

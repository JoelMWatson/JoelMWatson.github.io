## Class 34 Reading: React Native

#### React Native

React native is a great tool where you can build out mobile applications entirely
with javascript and release them on IOS and Android. This is great for companies
with less money for development as it is much less coding to build out two versions
of the same app on different devices. The downside is that the natively written
applications run faster and smoother in their native environments.

#### Getting Started

There are two main ways in which you can start writing an React Native application.
One way is with React-Native is with the React-Native-Client. This allows you the most
control over your build but it also requires a better understanding of the tool
and the operating systems you are developing for. The other common way to start a
React Native project is with Expo Client. Expo is a set of tools built around
React Native that simplifies the process when getting started allowing you to get
to coding your actual application in minutes with the command `expo init`
